# OcraCachedViewResolver

OcraCachedViewResolver is performance-oriented Zend Framework 2 Module that increases performance
in your application by caching the process of resolving template names to template paths.

In ZF2, the process of resolving template paths causes a lot of stat calls. This module adds
a cache layer to avoid that.
